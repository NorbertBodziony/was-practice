# A. Identify interoperability and compatibility issues.
## Study topics related to strategies used by people with disabilities
Some highlights of the types of things to look for include:
1. Keyboard accessibility

    a) Actionable elements (links, buttons, controls, etc.) are focusable with the keyboard

    b) All focusable elements must have a visible focus indicator

    c) Logical tab order

    d) No keyboard trap
2. Touch device accessibility

    a) Sufficiently large touch target size

    b) Allowing different screen orientations

    c) Extra considerations for when the screen reader is turned on 

    d) Custom gesture events must have an alternative method for activation (e.g. by activating a button)

    e) Motion-activated events (e.g. shaking the device) must have an alternative method for activation (e.g. clicking a button)
